# ft_printf
Recreates the printf function from the standard C library. (It emulates almost everything).

**How to use**: It works just like printf. :)

**Milestone Note**: This was my first bigger and complex function, so yes I was proud, when I finished this.  
These were humble beginnings in starting C.
